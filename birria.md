## Birria 
### Spicy Beef in a Pepper Sauce for Tacos 
_based on_ https://www.isabeleats.com/authentic-birria/ 

### Ingredients 

- 5lbs chuck roast, chopped into rough cubes
- 12 dried guajillo chiles
- 5 dried ancho chiles
- 5-10 dried arbol chiles
- 1 can tomato paste 
- 1 medium yellow onion, quartered 
- 1 stick Mexican cinnamon (or 1 Tsp powdered cinnamon)
- 3 bay leaves
- 1 quart strong broth (beef broth preferred)
- 1/4 cup white vinegar 
- 5 cloves garlic, microplaned
- 1 tsp. ground cumin
- 1 tsp. dried Mexican oregano
- Salt & pepper to taste, on standby 
  
## Method 

- Roughly chop the meat into large cubes and generously salt the cubes; let meat rest while you make the sauce  
- In an Instant Pot, place the dried chiles, onion, broth, garlic, vinegar, tomato paste, and spices -- every other ingredient -- and pressure cook for 10 minutes. Once the pressure is done, mix the contents well and transfer to a blender, likely in two batches unless your blender is very large.
- SAFETY: When you blend the mixture, the hot liquid will rapidly heat the air in the blender, which can force the lid off. Place a dark-colored towel on top of the lid, and hold down the towel with a free hand wearing an oven mitt. Press firmly before turning on the blender. Blend the mixture for a minute or more until you achieve a uniform sauce. 
- Place the beef in the Instant Pot and cover with sauce. Pressure cook for 1 minute to bring the sauce to boiling, then set the cooker to Slow Cook / Keep Warm.
- Check after 2-3 hours and then periodically thereafter until the beef is fall-apart tender. Break up the chunks and stir gently, leaving inch-sized chunks intact if you can.  
- Serve in bowls as a stew with cheese on top, or as taco filling (using the oil on top of the sauce to fry up the tortillas first)
