# Pumpkin Pudding Pie
with orange zest & cardamom whipped cream
_Demi Adejuyigbe's recipe_

Makes three pies, or fills two deep-dish crusts.

## Ingredients 

- Three pie crusts (or two deep-dish), from any recipe you like 
- 2½ cups sugar
- One 15oz. can pumpkin puree
- 2 eggs
- ½ tsp. baking soda
- 2 cups flour
- 2 tsp. baking powder
- ½ tsp. ground cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp. vanilla
- pinch of salt
- 2½ cups milk
- 4 Tbsp butter, melted
- 1 orange
- 1 tsp. powdered sugar
- 1 cup heavy cream (leave in refrigerator until needed) 
- 2 Tbsp. powdered sugar
- 1 pinch nutmeg

## Method 

1. Preheat oven to 325F and set out pie crusts to reach room temperature 
2. In a large mixing bowl or a stand mixer with paddle attachment, blend the sugar, puree, eggs, and baking soda. 
3. Add in the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, vanilla, and salt; blend until well mixed.
4. Switch to a whisk or your mixer's whisk attachment, then add the milk and melted butter; whisk until well mixed. 
5. Batter should be more liquid than solid. Pour into your pie crusts filling right up to the edge. Don't worry, it will firm up!
6. Bake at 325F for 55 minutes, then remove from oven and let cool. While the pies are baking, use a microplane or similar to remove the zest from an orange. Place a small clean metal mixing bowl and whisk (or beaters for your hand mixer) into the freezer. 
7. While the pies are cooling, in your cold bowl, whisk together 2 Tbsp powdered sugar, 1 tsp. cardamom, and a pinch of nutmeg. Pour in 1 cup heavy whipping cream and whisk or hand-mix until stiff peaks form. 
8. **Only once the pie is cool,** gently spread the orange zest across the top of the pie, then dust with powdered sugar.
9. Slice the cooled, zested, and dusted pies; serve each slice with a dollop of spiced whipped cream.
