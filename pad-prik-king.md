## Ingredients 

- 1 can Maesri Prik King Curry sauce (green)
- 3 lbs. thin sliced pork medallions
- 2 lbs. long podded cowpea / Chinese "long bean" (or substitute French green beans)
- 1/2 c. brown sugar
- 1/4 c. fish sauce
- 4 cloves garlic, microplaned 
- 1 bunch scallions, finely chopped, whites and greens separated 
- 4 shallots, finely diced 
- 2 Tbsp. sesame oil 
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Jasmine rice 

## Method 

1. **Prepare the rice.** Either prepare the jasmine rice ahead of mealtime, or start a batch fresh in your rice cooker around step 5. 
2. **Prepare the pork.** Make stacks of 2-4 medallions, slice lengthwise once then crosswise 5-6 times to get narrow bite-size rectangles. Toss to coat with salt & pepper and let sit.
3. **Prepare the long beans.** Cut long beans into 1-2" pieces. Discard the ends. Let sit.
4. **Sear the pork.** In a large cast iron pot, heat the sesame oil until it's shimmering. Add the pork and stir-fry over high heat until the pork is seared and lightly browned outside. It should not be cooked through. Remove the pork from the heat but leave the oils in the pot at temperature.
5. **Start the sauce.** Toss the diced shallots and white scallions into the pork fat and sesame oil and cook until they are nearly translucent. Add in the prik king curry and garlic. Stir and splash in a little fish sauce until the mixture is a uniform red paste.
6. **Cook the curry.** Add in the pork and stir to coat. Cook until the pork is nearly finished then toss in the long beans. Once the beans begin to release water and steam, add in the brown sugar and the rest of the fish sauce. Continue stirring to keep the meat and veggies coated in sauce, until most of the water evaporates and the sauce thickens.

Remove from heat and serve over jasmine rice. Makes 12-18 servings.
