# Corn Pone
_Parsons family recipe,_ 
_from Catherine "Kitty" Pusey's recipe_

## ingredients 
- 4c. boiling water
- 3c. yellow cornmeal
- 2c. cold water
- 1c. flour
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1/4c. sugar
- 1/4c. molasses (don't pour this into a measuring cup - see method)  
- 2 eggs
- About 2 Tbsp butter or bacon fat  

## method
Preheat oven to 375F. Aggressively butter or grease a deep cast iron skillet. In a large mixing bowl or stand mixer, pour boiling water over cornmeal. Beat until the lumps are almost gone. Pour in cold water to quench cornmeal, and beat well. In sequence, add eggs, flour, salt, and sugar. Beat well. While mixing, pour in molasses directly from the bottle until about 1/4c. has been dispensed, or when color goes from yellow to medium amber. Once thoroughly mixed, pour contents into your buttered skillet. Cover and bake at 375F for an hour, then turn off the oven and let it sit in the oven for at least another 30 minutes. Once cool and solidified you may turn out the pone onto aluminum foil and wrap it up for later. Refrigerate until serving; keeps for several days. 

## serving 
While breakfast meats are frying on a griddle, slice corn pone into bricks no more than 1" thick. Remove breakfast meats from low heat, turn heat to medium, and fry the corn pone in the remaining grease. (If not cooking breakfast meats you can fry pone on a buttered griddle.) Flip at least once, cooking until surfaces darken and become slightly crisp. Cook eggs last or on the other half of the griddle. Serve with butter or syrup, alongside the eggs and breakfast meats.
