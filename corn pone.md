# Corn Pone
from Catherine "Kitty" Pusey's recipe

## ingredients 
4c. boiling water
3c. yellow cornmeal
2c. cold water
1c. flour
1 tsp. salt
1/4c. sugar
1/4c. molasses
2 eggs 

## method
Preheat oven to 375F. In a large mixing bowl, pour boiling water over cornmeal. Beat until the lumps are almost gone. Pour in cold water. Beat well. Add eggs, flour, salt, sugar, and molasses. Beat well. Pour contents into a heavy iron skillet. Cover and bake at 375 for an hour, then turn off the oven and let it sit in the oven for at least another 30 minutes. Refrigerate until serving.

## serving 
While breakfast meats are frying, slice corn pone into bricks no more than 1" thick. Remove breakfast meats from heat and fry the corn pone in the remaining grease. Flip once, cooking until surfaces darken and become slightly crisp. Serve with butter or syrup. Also great for sopping up egg yolk from over-easy eggs.
