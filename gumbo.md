# Chicken & Sausage Gumbo 
_based on Daniel Gritzer's gumbo from Serious Eats_ 
Makes about seven quarts 

## Gumbo spices 
- 2 parts cayenne
- 2 parts celery salt
- 1 part paprika
- 1 part salt
- 1 part black pepper
- 1 part garlic powder
- 1 part onion powder
- 1/2 part allspice

## Ingredients 
_This is gumbo - all volumes are approximate!_

- One large family pack of boneless skinless chicken (5 lbs. or more), thighs or breasts 
- 1 quart homemade stock or bone broth 
- About 1c. bacon fat or lard
- About 1c. flour
- About 1-1/2 lbs. smoked sausage, sliced into medallions 
- About 1/2 lb. Andouille sausage, sliced into medallions
- 2 or more green bell peppers, finely diced 
- 2 or more white onions, finely diced
- Over 1 lb. of celery heart, finely diced
- At least 8 cloves of garlic, microplaned or very finely chopped 
- 1 small can tomato puree or sauce
- ~2 Tbsp fish sauce
- ~2 Tbsp soy sauce
- ~2 Tbsp cayenne sauce ("Texas Pete", "Crystal", "Frank's")  

## Method 

1. **Coat the chicken in spices**, using about 2 Tbsp of the spice mix for 5lbs. chicken. More spice mix here is the main driver of how spicy the gumbo becomes. Set the chicken aside in an airtight container to absorb its rub.
2. **Make the roux**. Heat the oven to 350F. In an 8qt Dutch oven, melt the bacon fat or lard and gradually add in flour, whisking, until thicker than gravy but not gritty. Whisk every 20-30 minutes in between doing other prep tasks. Remove onto the stovetop when the roux is the color of dark peanut butter or light chocolate; reduce oven to 205F.
3. **Prep the other ingredients**. Onions will get finely diced, and go into their own container. Celery, green pepper, and garlic will also be finely diced and can go in their own container. Sausage will be sliced into thin medallions can go in its own container. 
4. **Recycling.** Reserve the inedible remainders from the garlick, onion, celery, and pepper to cook in a pressure cooker with any chicken or pork bones you have from other recipes; add kelp, dried mushrooms, and/or bonito flakes and pressure cook for ~1hr to make the bone broth for the next batch. 
5. **Stovetop mixing.** With the roux pot on medium heat, add onions and stir vigorously until they turn clear. Add in celery, peppers, and garlic and stir until combined, steaming, and aromatic. Put the spiced chicken into the veggie mix and mix around until the chicken is coated with sticky vegetable-and-roux mixture. Dump in the sausage medallions and pour the stock or broth over everything. Stir until the ingredients are well mixed together. Add a splash of fish sauce, soy sauce, and cayenne sauce each. 
6. **Cook overnight**. For about eight hours, leave the gumbo in the oven at 205F with the lid on.
7. **Season and serve.** Remove from the oven, stir until the chicken shreds, and add 1 small can of tomato puree. Taste the mixture and add more fish sauce, soy sauce, or cayenne sauce as desired. Serve over white rice and thicken with gumbo fil√©. Optionally add freshly cooked shrimp or crawfish.
