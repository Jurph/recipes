# Winter Potato Soup
Makes about seven quarts 

## Ingredients 
_This is soup - all volumes are approximate!_

- 1 bunch scallions  
- 1 large yellow (sweet) onion, finely diced  
- 1 lb. whole carrots    
- 1 large head of celery 
- 3 lbs. Russet potatoes  
- 1 stick of butter 
- At least 4 cloves of garlic, microplaned or very finely chopped
- 1 c. shredded parmesan, plus more for topping 
- 1 c. heavy cream
- 1/2 c. dry vermouth or white wine
- 2 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce 
- Sage, thyme, black pepper, salt, and paprika 

## Method 

1. **Prep the onions**. Separate the scallions into white and green parts, finely dicing both. Finely dice the yellow onion. Reserve the scallion root tips and onion butts for future broth-making. Set aside the green scallions.
2. **Sweat the onions**. In a large pot put the diced onion, white scallions, and the stick of butter, then simmer on low heat to soften and partially caramelize. You can peel the carrots & potatoes and clean the celery while this is happening. Season with sage and thyme and stir occasionally to get even cooking. 
3. **Finely mince the celery and carrots**. By hand or in a food processor, reduce the celery and carrot to tiny pieces. By the time you're done the onion will probably be translucent. Add the carrot and celery and bring up the heat to medium. Reserve the carrot peelings and celery leaves & butts for future broth-making. 
4. **Peel and cut the potatoes**. Cube the potatoes into one-inch chunks, stirring the simmering veggies between every 2-3 potatoes. By the time you're done the carrots should be soft and browning.
5. **Brown the veggies**. Bring the vegetable mix to high heat and stir rapidly, watching for the veggies to begin browning. Deglaze with vermouth or wine, reducing heat back to low-medium and stirring rapidly. Add the microplaned garlic after deglazing, so it doesn't burn. 
6. **Boil the potatoes**. Add 2+ quarts of broth and raise the heat to medium-high to bring it to a boil. Add in the potato chunks carefully, so you don't get splashed with boiling soup. Stir in the potatoes, reduce heat to medium, and simmer / low boil for 20 minutes or until potatoes are very soft. If the soup is not filling the pot you've chosen, you can add more potatoes, broth, water, or milk without much penalty - but mark up your copy of the recipe and note that, for your pot, more potatoes and/or broth are needed.   
7. **Blend**. Using a potato masher or slotted spoon, break up the potato chunks. If they don't break up easily, keep boiling them! Once the chunks are breaking easily, turn off the heat and use an immersion blender or whisk to smooth the soup's texture. Add heavy cream and parmesan and continue blending until smooth and pale.
8. **Season the soup** with black pepper, paprika, Worcestershire sauce, and more salt to taste.
9. **Portion into bowls** and top with green scallions. Diced bacon or shredded cheese are also delicious as toppings. 

## The Freedom of Soup 

This is a **potato soup base** and you should feel free to improvise. Want to dice a pound of bacon into the pot with the onion at the start instead of butter, for the fat base? Great! Want to swap in daikon, turnips, leeks...? Okay! How about twice as much garlic? I'm not judging you. How about doubling the onion volume, and totally caramelizing them instead of just sweating them to translucency? Swap in cheddar or gruyere instead of parmesan, or do all three. Deglaze with a weissbeir or vodka, add fish sauce or Marmite for more umami. Choose more colorful veggies like purple carrots or potatoes or beets to get a darker color. Sprinkle in soft shredded pork or cooked ground turkey. _It's a soup!_
