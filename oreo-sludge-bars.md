# Oreo Sludge Bars 
*after jessicapierce, whose friend Paula invented them* 

Oreo Sludge Bars are a very dense brownie-like treat. A single recipe makes 30 or 40 dense little cubes of sweet chocolatey goodness, which disappear quickly at most parties. 

## Ingredients 

- Approx. 30 Oreo sandwich cookies
- 1 cup flour
- 1 (14oz.) can sweetened condensed milk
- 1/2 lb. chocolate chips (this used to be "half a bag" but check your bag)
- 1 stick of unsalted butter, softened 
- (optional) vanilla extract
- (optional) coconut flakes
- (optional) pinch of espresso powder
- (optional) you get the idea 

## Method 

1. Preheat oven to 375F. 
2. Divide the Oreos, flour, and chips into approximately equal batches that will fit into a food processor. Blitz until a gray powder emerges. Combine the batches of gray powder into a large mixing bowl. If you lack a food processor, use a potato masher, chef's knife, meat tenderizing hammer, etc. to smash the Oreos into crumbs and then combine with the whole chips and flour. (If you know you don't have a food processor, consider buying small/fine chips to start with.)
3. Start the butter melting on the stove top or microwave, and open the can of condensed milk. Pour the condensed milk into the gray powder and then pour in the hot melted butter. Stir to combine until completely homogenous. The result should be the titular **Oreo Sludge**, a thick, tarry black goo that easily forms a ball in the mixing bowl. 
4. Scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula and decant the Oreo Sludge into a 9x9 pan (a disposable aluminum pan works fine, but so does glass). Smooth and flatten the sludge into a uniform layer in the pan.
5. Bake at 375F for 20-25 minutes, looking for a pale crust to form on top or at the edges.
6. Let the Oreo Sludge Bars cool to room temperature and then refrigerate before cutting into approx. 1" cubes. Serve on a tray lined with paper towels.

Since the recipe was written, Nabisco has released Gluten-free Oreos. I have had success using Gluten-Free Oreos with a mix of buckwheat and almond flour; all of the other ingredients are already gluten-free. Especially for holiday parties where GF goods may be in short supply it's great to be able to include your GF friends.
